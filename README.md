# AIM: 
To Study & Implementation of Sub queries Views .     
    
# THEORY:
## SUBQUERIES: 
The query within another is known as a subquery. A statement containing a subquery is called a parent statement. The rows returned by subquery are used by the parent statement or in other words A subquery is a SELECT statement that is embedded in a clause of another SELECT statement 
You can place the subquery in a number of SQL clauses: 
1) WHERE clause  
2) HAVING clause  
3) FROM clause  
4) OPERATORS( IN.ANY,ALL,<,>,>=,<= etc..)

## Types:
### 1. Sub queries that return several values 
Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.

### 2. Multiple queries 
Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords. 

### 3. Correlated subquery 
A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

## VIEW: 
In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database. You can add SQL functions, WHERE, and JOIN statements to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table. A view is a virtual table, which consists of a set of columns from one or more tables. It is similar to a table but it does not store in the database. View is a query stored as an object. 
### Syntax: 
CREATE VIEW 
AS 
SELECT FROM relation_name WHERE (Condition)

## DROPPING A VIEW:
 A view can be deleted with the DROP VIEW command.
### Syntax:
DROP VIEW ;
